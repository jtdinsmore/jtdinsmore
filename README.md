I'm Jack Dinsmore, a PhD student in physics at Stanford University. I research high energy astrophysics, and this is my physics GitHub account. It contains the code and other digital assets for papers I was the first author of.

My professional website with my resume, CV, and additional information are at [jack-dinsmore.github.io](https://jack-dinsmore.github.io/).

My [personal github](https://github.com/jack-dinsmore) is much more complete. It contains in-progress scientific code, code for science I've collaborated on, and personal projects.
